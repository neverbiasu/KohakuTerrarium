"""
Ensemble Voting — multiple agents solve the same problem, best answer wins.

Demonstrates:
  - ``&`` (parallel): 3 agents run simultaneously on the same input
  - ``>>`` with auto-wrap: pipe tuple of results through a voting function
  - ``|`` (fallback): if ensemble fails, fall back to a single expert
  - ``* N`` (retry): retry the ensemble if voting is inconclusive

Pattern: redundancy through diversity. Different models/prompts produce
different outputs. A voting function picks the best one. More reliable
than any single agent.

Usage:
    python ensemble_voting.py "What causes rain?"
