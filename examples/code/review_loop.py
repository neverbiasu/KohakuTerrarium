"""
Review Loop — writer and reviewer iterate until approval.

Demonstrates:
  - ``async for`` with ``.iterate()``: native loop with break condition
  - ``>>`` chaining agents with transforms between them
  - ``agent()`` persistent agents: both remember the full conversation,
    so the reviewer sees the evolution and the writer sees all feedback

This is the canonical "write → review → revise → review → approve" loop
that can't be expressed as a terrarium (needs strict turn ordering and
a convergence check controlled by your code).

Usage:
    python review_loop.py "Write a haiku about programming"
