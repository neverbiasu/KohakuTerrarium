# Terrarium - The Wiring Layer

## The Idea

Most multi-agent frameworks force you to choose: either everything is hierarchical (one boss, many workers) or everything is peer-to-peer (everyone equal). Both break down at scale.

KohakuTerrarium says: **use both, at different levels.**

```
    Vertical (inside a creature)       Horizontal (between creatures)

         Controller                  brainstorm <---> planner
         /       \                        |              |
    sub-agent  sub-agent              channels        channels
                                          |              |
    Hierarchical delegation           writer <-----> reviewer
    for task decomposition
                                     Peer collaboration
                                     for multi-role teams
```

The **creature** handles the vertical. The **terrarium** handles the horizontal. The boundary is clean: a creature does not know it is in a terrarium.

## What a Terrarium Does

A terrarium is **not** an agent. It has no LLM, no decision-making, no intelligence. It is pure wiring:

1. **Loads** standalone creature configs (unchanged from their solo use)
2. **Creates channels** connecting creatures
3. **Injects triggers** so creatures react to incoming channel messages
4. **Injects topology** into each creature's system prompt ("you can send to X, you receive from Y")
5. **Manages lifecycle** (start, stop, monitor)
6. **Provides an API** for external interaction

## The Opacity Principle

Creatures are opaque. The terrarium cannot inspect or modify their internals.

```
+-------------+     +-------------------+     +-----------------+
|  Creatures  |     |  Terrarium Layer  |     | Human Interface |
|  (opaque)   |<--->|  (wiring)         |<--->| (pluggable)     |
|             |     |                   |     |                 |
| Has:        |     | Has:              |     | Has:            |
| - LLM       |     | - Channels        |     | - CLI           |
| - Tools     |     | - Triggers        |     | - HTTP API      |
| - Sub-agents|     | - Lifecycle       |     | - Web UI        |
| - Memory    |     | - Prompt injection|     | - nothing       |
+-------------+     +-------------------+     +-----------------+
```

This mirrors the microservice pattern:
- Creature = microservice (private internals, external interface)
- Terrarium = service mesh (routing, lifecycle, no business logic)
- Channels = message queues

## Communication Model

Creatures communicate **explicitly** through channels. The terrarium never silently pipes creature output into channels.

**Receiving**: The terrarium injects `ChannelTrigger`s. Messages arrive automatically as events. The creature does not poll or call `wait_channel`.

**Sending**: The creature calls `send_message` when its workflow requires it. The LLM decides what to share.

```
brainstorm creature:
  1. Receives seed prompt (via trigger)
  2. Thinks, generates ideas
  3. Sends best idea to "ideas" channel  <-- explicit decision

planner creature:
  1. Receives idea (via trigger, automatic)
  2. Plans chapter outlines
  3. Sends each outline to "outline" channel  <-- explicit decision
```

## Topologies

Different wiring patterns emerge from channel configuration:

```
Pipeline:                    Hub-and-spoke:
  A --> [ch] --> B --> [ch]      architect --> [tasks] --> worker_1
       --> C                     architect --> [tasks] --> worker_2
                                 worker_* --> [results] --> architect

Group chat:                  Hybrid:
  A --+                         A --> [queue] --> B
  B --+--> [broadcast] --> all  all <--> [broadcast] <--> all
  C --+
```

All topologies are just channel configuration - no code changes needed.

## Defining a Terrarium

```yaml
terrarium:
  name: novel_writer
  creatures:
    - name: brainstorm
      config: ./creatures/brainstorm/
      channels:
        listen: [seed, team_chat]
        can_send: [ideas, team_chat]
    - name: planner
      config: ./creatures/planner/
      channels:
        listen: [ideas, team_chat]
        can_send: [outline, team_chat]
  channels:
    seed:      { type: queue, description: "User prompt" }
    ideas:     { type: queue, description: "Story concepts" }
    outline:   { type: queue, description: "Chapter outlines" }
    team_chat: { type: broadcast, description: "Shared context" }
```

Creatures point to standalone agent configs. The terrarium adds the wiring. The creature configs do not change.

See [Configuration Reference](../develop/configuration.md) for all fields. See [Channels](channels.md) for channel types and semantics.
