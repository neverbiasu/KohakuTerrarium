# Architecture Overview

This section describes how KohakuTerrarium works internally. For what the key abstractions are and why they exist, see [Concepts](../concept/README.md).

## Three Layers

KohakuTerrarium is organized into three layers:

| Layer | Location | Purpose | Docs |
|-------|----------|---------|------|
| **Agent Framework** | `src/kohakuterrarium/core/`, `modules/`, `parsing/`, `prompt/`, `builtins/` | Single-agent runtime: controller, tools, sub-agents, parsing, prompts | [Framework Internals](framework.md) |
| **Terrarium Runtime** | `src/kohakuterrarium/terrarium/` | Multi-agent orchestration: config, wiring, lifecycle, observer, hot-plug | [Terrarium Runtime](terrarium-runtime.md) |
| **Serving Layer** | `src/kohakuterrarium/serving/` | Transport-agnostic API: KohakuManager, AgentSession, event streaming | [Serving Layer](serving.md) |

The HTTP API (`apps/api/`) is an application layer built on top of the serving layer.

## Design Principles

1. **Controller as orchestrator** - the controller dispatches tasks, it does not produce long output itself. Heavy work goes to tools and sub-agents.

2. **Non-blocking tool execution** - tools start immediately when detected during LLM streaming, not queued until the response ends. Multiple tools run in parallel.

3. **Unified event model** - everything flows through `TriggerEvent`: user input, timer triggers, tool completions, sub-agent output, channel messages.

4. **Creature opacity** - a terrarium never inspects or modifies creature internals. Communication is always explicit via channels.

5. **Configuration-driven** - agents are defined declaratively in YAML. Custom behavior comes from pluggable modules.
